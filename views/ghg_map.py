    This interactive map visualises carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions over time for UNFCCC Annex I countries.  
    Explore how these nations have shaped global emissions since 1990, data submitted under the earliest international climate agreements, when the world first united under the UNFCCC to address climate change.

                Since **1992**, countries have been required to report their greenhouse gas emissions annually.

                binding emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol.

                -  **Standardised methodology** across all countries
                -  **Independent verification** by international experts  
                -  **Policy-relevant** - directly used for climate negotiations
