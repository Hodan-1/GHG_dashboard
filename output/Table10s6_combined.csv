3.B.2: Further information is available as a supplementary file in the NIR to facilitate N flow calculations for manure management.
3.B.2.5 N2O Emissions per MMS: The total amount of N from all sources does not include the amount that will later be burned for fuel. The estimates are lower between 1992 and 2015 by 4.5 to 16%. This seems to be due to the CRF not adding this source but it does not affect emissions. 
-: 
-: Indirect emissions of N2O from nitrogen fertilisation of forests and from N mineralisation associated with carbon stock losses as a result of land use change are reported here.
-: Indirect emissions of N2O from nitrogen fertilisation of forests are reported here.
4.A.1 Carbon stock change: This category includes carbon stock changes and CO2 emissions from drainage from forests which were established more than 20 years before the inventory year . The area is adjusted over time to reflect deforestation losses - this is discussed further in the NIR.
4.A.1 Direct N2O Emissions: Established forests do not receive nitrogen fertilizer applications in the UK.		

4.A.1 Mineralization: There are no direct N2O emissions arising from historic land use change on Forest remaining Forest Land.
4.A.1 Biomass Burning: Includes all wildfires on Forest Land. There is assumed to be no land use change following wildfire.

3.B.2: Further information is available as a supplementary file in the NIR to facilitate N flow calculations for manure management.
3.B.2.5 N2O Emissions per MMS: The total amount of N from all sources does not include the amount that will later be burned for fuel. The estimates are lower between 1992 and 2015 by 4.5 to 16%. This seems to be due to the CRF not adding this source but it does not affect emissions. 
-: 
-: Indirect emissions of N2O from nitrogen fertilisation of forests and from N mineralisation associated with carbon stock losses as a result of land use change are reported here.
-: Indirect emissions of N2O from nitrogen fertilisation of forests are reported here.
4.A.1 Carbon stock change: This category includes carbon stock changes and CO2 emissions from drainage from forests which were established more than 20 years before the inventory year . The area is adjusted over time to reflect deforestation losses - this is discussed further in the NIR.
4.A.1 Direct N2O Emissions: Established forests do not receive nitrogen fertilizer applications in the UK.		

4.A.1 Mineralization: There are no direct N2O emissions arising from historic land use change on Forest remaining Forest Land.
4.A.1 Biomass Burning: Includes all wildfires on Forest Land. There is assumed to be no land use change following wildfire.
Controlled burning does not take place in forests in the UK.

4.A.1 Controlled Burning: Controlled burning does not take place in forests in the UK.
4.A.1 Wildfires: Includes all wildfires on Forest Land. There is assumed to be no land use change following wildfire.
4.A.2 Carbon stock change: This category includes carbon stock changes and CO2 emissions from drainage from all forests that were established less than 20 years before the inventory year.
4.A.2.1: Conversion from Cropland to Forest is assumed to always result in a positive carbon stock change.
4.A.2.2: Conversion from Grassland to Forest is assumed to always result in a positive carbon stock change.
4.A.2.3: Conversion of Wetlands (peat extraction sites) is assumed to be to Grassland only.
4.A.2.4: Conversion from Settlement to Forest is assumed to always result in a positive carbon stock change.

4.A.1.1  Drained Organic Soils: 
4.A.1.2 Rewetted Organic Soils: Conversion to Wetlands occurs at rewetting.
4.A.2.1 Rewetted Mineral Soils: Emissions from rewetting are not estimated as there is insufficient information.
4.A.2.2 Other Minaral Soils: N2O emissions from drainage of forest soils arise from both mineral soils and organo-mineral soils (which are widespread in the UK and have a carbon content that falls mid-way between mineral and organic soils). Methane emissions from forest soils are not estimated as there is insufficient information.
4.B.1 Carbon stock change: This category includes soil carbon and biomass stock changes from historical land use change more than 20 years before the inventory year and from cropland management activities.
4.B.1 Biomass Burning: 
4.B.1 Controlled Burning: Burning of agricultural residues on Cropland is reported in Table 3.F and has not occurred in the UK since 1994.
4.B.1 Wildfires: Biomass burning emissions from wildfires on Cropland are reported here.
4.B.2 Carbon stock change: This category reports carbon stock changes due to conversion to Cropland in the 20 years before the inventory year.

3.B.2.5 N2O Emissions per MMS: The total amount of N from all sources does not include the amount that will later be burned for fuel. The estimates are lower between 1992 and 2015 by 4.5 to 16%. This seems to be due to the CRF not adding this source but it does not affect emissions.

4.C.1.1  Drained Organic Soils: 
4.C.1.2 Rewetted Organic Soils: 
4.C.2.1 Rewetted Mineral Soils: Emissions from rewetting are not estimated as there is insufficient information.
4.D.1 Carbon stock change: 
4.D.1.1: On-site emissions (carbon stock changes) due to peat extraction activities (for horticultural and fuel peat) and off-site emissions from horticultural peat are reported here. 
4.D.1.2: 
4.D.1.3: 
4.D.1 Direct N2O Emissions from N Inputs: There is no fertilisation of Wetlands in the UK.
4.D.1 Direct N2O Emissions: There are no direct N2O emissions arising from historic land use change of Wetlands remaining Wetlands.
4.D.1 Biomass Burning: 
4.D.1 Wildfires: There is no report of wildfires on Wetlands in the UK.
4.D.2 Carbon stock change: 
4.D.2.1: All conversion to Peat Extraction is assumed to be from Grassland. Only soil carbon stock changes are estimated, in line with the default methodology.
4.D.2.2: All conversion to Flooded Land (reservoir creation) is assumed to be from Grassland. Only living biomass losses are estimated, in line with default methodology.
4.D.2 Direct N2O Emissions: There is no fertilization of Wetlands in the UK.
4.D.2 Direct N2O Emissions: There are no direct N2O emissions arising from land use change to Wetlands.		

4.D.2 Biomass Burning: There is no report of wildfires on Wetlands in the UK.									

4.D.2 Wildfires: There is no report of wildfires on Wetlands in the UK.
4.D Emissions/Removal: 
4.D.1.1.1  Drained Organic Soils: There has been no recent conversion of Land to Peat Extraction Lands, but ongoing N2O emissions from past land conversion are reported here.
4.D.1.1.2 Rewetted Organic Soils: 
4.D.1.2.1 Rewetted Mineral Soils: Emissions from rewetting are not estimated as there is insufficient information.
4.E.1 Carbon stock change: This category includes soil carbon stock changes from historical land use change more than 20 years before the inventory year. The area of undisturbed settlement (with no associated carbon stock changes) is also reported.																

4.E.1Direct N2O Emissions: Emissions from fertilization of Settlements are assumed to be negligible.		

4.E.1 Direct N2O Emissions: N2O emissions from N mineralization associated with carbon stock losses from LUC to Settlements.
4.E.2 Carbon stock change: This category reports carbon stock changes due to conversion to Settlements in the 20 years before the inventory year. Carbon stock changes in living biomass are assumed to take place in a single year. Changes in stocks of dead biomass are included with changes in stocks of living biomass. Reported stock changes are net values entered as either Gains or Losses as appropriate.
4.E.2.1: Losses of living biomass due to deforestation (60%) are reported here (matched by a corresponding increase in the Harvested Wood Products pool). The remaining 40% is taken into account under 4(V) Biomass Burning/Controlled Burning.
4.E.2.4: 
4.E.2 Direct N2O Emissions: Emissions from fertilization of Settlements are assumed to be negligible.

4.E Biomass Burning: Emissions arising from controlled burning as a result of deforestation to Settlements are reported here.
4.F.2 Carbon stock change: Conversion of land to the Other Land category is negligible.
4.F.3: There are no direct N2O emissions arising from land use change to Other Land.
4.G.B Approach: 
4.G.B Information Item: The amount of HWP in SWDS are not currently estimated.

4.G.B HWP in SWDS: The amount of HWP in SWDS are not currently estimated.
4.H: Emissions for 4(II) 4.C and 4.E which do not have rows / cells available in the standard tables are reported here. All emissions for 4(I) and 4(V) are reported in the relevant standard tables.

3.B.2: Further information is available as a supplementary file in the NIR to facilitate N flow calculations for manure management.
3.B.2.5 N2O Emissions per MMS: The total amount of N from all sources does not include the amount that will later be burned for fuel. The estimates are lower between 1992 and 2015 by 4.5 to 16%. This seems to be due to the CRF not adding this source but it does not affect emissions. 
-: 
-: Indirect emissions of N2O from nitrogen fertilisation of forests and from N mineralisation associated with carbon stock losses as a result of land use change are reported here.
-: Indirect emissions of N2O from nitrogen fertilisation of forests are reported here.
4.A.1 Carbon stock change: This category includes carbon stock changes and CO2 emissions from drainage from forests which were established more than 20 years before the inventory year . The area is adjusted over time to reflect deforestation losses - this is discussed further in the NIR.
4.A.1 Direct N2O Emissions: Established forests do not receive nitrogen fertilizer applications in the UK.		

4.A.1 Mineralization: There are no direct N2O emissions arising from historic land use change on Forest remaining Forest Land.
4.A.1 Biomass Burning: Includes all wildfires on Forest Land. There is assumed to be no land use change following wildfire.
Controlled burning does not take place in forests in the UK.

4.A.1 Controlled Burning: Controlled burning does not take place in forests in the UK.
4.A.1 Wildfires: Includes all wildfires on Forest Land. There is assumed to be no land use change following wildfire.
4.A.2 Carbon stock change: This category includes carbon stock changes and CO2 emissions from drainage from all forests that were established less than 20 years before the inventory year.
4.A.2.1: Conversion from Cropland to Forest is assumed to always result in a positive carbon stock change.
4.A.2.2: Conversion from Grassland to Forest is assumed to always result in a positive carbon stock change.
4.A.2.3: Conversion of Wetlands (peat extraction sites) is assumed to be to Grassland only.
4.A.2.4: Conversion from Settlement to Forest is assumed to always result in a positive carbon stock change.

4.A.2 Direct N2O Emissions: 
4.A.2 Inorganic N Fertilizers: Nitrogen fertilizer is only applied to newly planted forests in the UK. Further detail can be found in the NIR.
4.A.2 Organic N Fertilizers: Organic fertilizers are not applied to forests in the UK.
4.A.2 Mineralization: N2O emissions from N mineralization associated with carbon stock losses from LUC to Forest Land.
4.A.2 Biomass Burning: Any emissions from wildfires on Land converted to Forest Land are included with Forest Land remaining Forest Land/4(V) Biomass Burning/Wildfires.
Controlled burning does not take place in forests in the UK.
4.A.2 Controlled Burning: Controlled burning does not take place in forests in the UK.
4.A.2 Wildfires: Any emissions from wildfires on Land converted to Forest Land are included with Forest Land remaining Forest Land/4(V) Biomass Burning/Wildfires.

4.A.1.1  Drained Organic Soils: 
4.A.1.2 Rewetted Organic Soils: Conversion to Wetlands occurs at rewetting.
4.A.2.1 Rewetted Mineral Soils: Emissions from rewetting are not estimated as there is insufficient information.
4.A.2.2 Other Minaral Soils: N2O emissions from drainage of forest soils arise from both mineral soils and organo-mineral soils (which are widespread in the UK and have a carbon content that falls mid-way between mineral and organic soils). Methane emissions from forest soils are not estimated as there is insufficient information.
4.B.1 Carbon stock change: This category includes soil carbon and biomass stock changes from historical land use change more than 20 years before the inventory year and from cropland management activities.
4.B.1 Biomass Burning: 
4.B.1 Controlled Burning: Burning of agricultural residues on Cropland is reported in Table 3.F and has not occurred in the UK since 1994.
4.B.1 Wildfires: Biomass burning emissions from wildfires on Cropland are reported here.
4.B.2 Carbon stock change: This category reports carbon stock changes due to conversion to Cropland in the 20 years before the inventory year.
