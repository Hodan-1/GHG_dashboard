    'CH\u2084 (kt)': (
        "**Methane (CH\u2084 )** is a potent greenhouse gas, and its distribution is often concentrated "

        "**Nitrous Oxide (N\u2082O)** primarily comes from the **agriculture sector**, particularly from soil "

        "**Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)** are a type of F-gas. They are not naturally occurring and are primarily "
        "used in industrial applications like refrigeration and air conditioning. In some cases, a specific "
        "industry's emissions might be 100% HFCs."

    'PFCs (kt)': (
        "**Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)** are potent F-gases. They are primarily a byproduct of industrial "

        "**Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF\u2086)** is an extremely potent F-gas with a long atmospheric lifetime. It "
        "is most commonly used as an electrical insulator in high-voltage equipment, which falls under "
        "the **industrial processes** sector."
