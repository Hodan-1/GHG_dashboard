"(7)   Parties are asked to report emissions from international aviation and international navigation and multilateral operations, as well as CO2 emissions from biomass and CO2 captured, under Memo Items.  These emissions should not be included in the national total emissions from the energy sector.  Amounts of biomass used as fuel are included in the national energy consumption but the corresponding CO2 emissions  are not included in the national total as it is assumed that the biomass is produced in a sustainable manner.  If the biomass is harvested at an unsustainable rate, net CO2 emissions  are accounted for as a loss of biomass stocks in the Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry sector.
